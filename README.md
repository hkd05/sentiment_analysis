# Analysis and Visualization of YouTube Comments


* [Dave Castro's Week in Review series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_PcJRsjGRY&t=4s)
* This video was posted after a major CrossFit announcement.
* This project took the comments from that video and analyzed them based on positive/negative/neutral scores
* Based on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sentiment-analysis-of-youtube-comments/)
* Used Google API keys to first collect comments and store them into a text file which was then used in the analysis

## Files:
**wir_analysis.py** - code, originally written in Google Colab
**ytcomments.txt** - public comments collected from the "Week in Review" video
